    <h1>Aidan's Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>What you might catch him doing when he's free</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Practicing music; whether that be one of his primary instruments doing
        something he's working on, or something entirely unrelated for personal
        development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Folding Origami; another form of art he likes to make, this one more
        relaxing sometimes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Playing Video Games; some of his favorites include the Zelda series, the
        Horizon series, and the Monster Hunter series.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading/Watching Music Edutainment; often looking for new ideas that can
        inspire new approaches to the music work he does.
      </li>
    </ul>
